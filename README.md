## 📰 Multi-Agent AI Researcher

### 🎓What is this?
A multi-agent AI research assistant that streamlines Hacker News analysis by coordinating multiple AI agents. The application helps users discover trending stories and influential contributors, generate concise summaries, and extract insights for reports, blogs, and social media content.

This Streamlit app empowers you to research top stories and users on HackerNews using a team of AI assistants with GPT-4o. 

### Features
- Analyze top-performing stories and influential users on Hacker News
- Leverage a team of specialized AI assistants for in-depth story and user research
- Produce blog posts, reports, and social media content driven by targeted research queries

### How it works?

- Upon running the app, you will be prompted to enter your OpenAI API key. This key is used to authenticate and access the OpenAI language models.
- Once you provide a valid API key, three specialized AI agents are created:
    - **HackerNews Researcher**: Specializes in getting top stories from HackerNews using the HackerNews API.
    - **Web Searcher**: Searches the web for additional information on topics using DuckDuckGo search.
    - **Article Reader**: Reads and extracts content from article URLs using newspaper4k tools.

- These agents work together as a coordinated team under the **HackerNews Team** which orchestrates the research process.
- Enter your research query in the provided text input field. This could be a topic, keyword, or specific question related to HackerNews stories or users.
- The HackerNews Team follows a structured workflow:
    1. First searches HackerNews for relevant stories based on your query
    2. Uses the Article Reader to extract detailed content from the story URLs
    3. Leverages the Web Searcher to gather additional context and information
    4. Finally provides a thoughtful and engaging summary with title, summary, and reference links
- The generated content is structured as an Article with a title, summary, and reference links for easy review and use.
